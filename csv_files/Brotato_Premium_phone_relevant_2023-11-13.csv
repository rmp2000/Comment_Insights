Anthony Guzzo,2023/08/20,4,"I really like this game. It took me some time to get into it, but it's fun. One thing I wish it had, was some kind of a custom sandbox mode that didn't affect unlocks etc. Where you could choose whatever weapons/items/stat combos you wanted freely to experiment. It's fine without that though, I just sometimes want to see what it'd be like to have certain hard to get weapons fully maxed out, like the Gatling or obliterator."
Ricky Ricardo,2023/09/07,4,"same as the desktop version , just wish you had the same accessibility options.Edit2: updates have fixed most issue (not all) and added endless mode. Edit: after some time playing, found bug that limit gameplay. Beating a level difficulty doesn't process. Says I beat it but won't let me play the next. Turrets and mines spawn on edge of map. Also no endless mode"
ray weaver,2023/07/24,5,"Phenomenal game. Honestly just a way better vampire survivors. Amazing Stat system, amazing weapon system, and not too easy but not too difficult for the most part. The only issue I have with this game is the butcher is seriously grossly overpowered for the mobile version because movement is more difficult on mobile. It sucks having an amazing run going only to have it cut short because I was unlucky enough to run into him on wave 11. Needs to be patched and toned down ASAP."
Zack Hatfield,2023/05/16,4,"Brotato is exactly what I'm looking for in a premium game. It is easy to learn but hard to master and there's a decent amount of content. And the content isn't behind microtranactionsüòÉ it's really refreshing. I prefer these types of games to games reliant on in app purchases. There could be more diversity with the enemies and map. But the simplicity is nice. There could also be more of a tutorial for learning game mechanics. Even just a quick briefing. Overall, a very fun gameü§å"
Nicholas James,2023/04/22,2,"Fun for a bit, but due to bugs and slow patches the mobile version is quite a bit less fun than the computer version. Homestly, purchase the non-mobile version and you'll have a much better time. I've lost my progress twice due to patches, and higher level play is significantly more difficult due to changes in the coding of enemy speed on mobile."
Trey Ritter,2023/04/04,4,"Really enjoy this game. Great replayability and you can unlock harder difficulties so you can test you skill or just casually play for a few minutes if you need to pass the time. I just wish there was controller support because on screen controls tend to be finicky, hence the 4‚≠ê. But I will give it full 5 if this gets added! Thank you for a great game!"
Alli m,2023/04/22,4,"I love this game so much on PC that I had to get it on my phone. I would give it 5 stars but there's a frustrating bug that puts me back to aggression level 1 or 2 when I've unlocked danger level 4. I like to grind for achievements, but doing it over and over again to just get back to where I am is frustrating"
Jacob,2023/03/29,5,"I saw this game on a YouTube video and it looked addictively fun(it is) and I'm really excited it was released on mobile. My only issue is that cloud save won't connect even when I have internet and also a zoom slider in the options menu would be nice. Other than that it's a very fun game ,the effects and simple controls make it satisfyingly relaxing"
Alejandro Salud,2023/04/10,4,"Overall I feel like this is a great port of the game as I have been addicted to the game since I bought it, but I have run into issues. sometimes there are audio issues when you hit too many targets, which is minor issue. One big problem I'm facing is unlocking streamer and speedster(?) where I meet the required speed but don't unlock the character and its really been bugging me. Another problem I saw was that arms dealer didn't have a weapon at every shop which kind of ended that run."
Ben Ordal,2023/04/10,2,"Edit: Keep finding more game breaking bugs. Slow weapons will all attack the same target instead of multiple different enemy. Food won't magnetize. If you unlock danger level 1-5, the game won't remember it so you will have to start over at 1. The -20% speed unlock does not work. Accessibility options are listed under game description but are nowhere to be found. Love this game on PC but the mobile port is not tuned correctly. The bosses hit way harder and faster on mobile."
Jeff R,2023/04/22,4,"The game has been amazing, and I play it as often as I can. I've only been having issues with the saver class. For some reason, while playing as them, your armor will randomly drop without explanation, making it hard to progress. I've ehecked out full description and held items to be sure."
Aaron Cordova,2023/03/30,4,"The game is great on mobile. Only issues are: 1. When you play for achievements, if you exit the game after obtaining one, it doesn't save it, forcing you to replay to obtain it again. 2. Sometimes the save states don't return you to the same game you exited. Would like to see a save option for the current run."
J W,2023/03/28,5,"An excellent mobile port for an excellent game! It runs identical to the pc version and touch controls are just *chef's kiss*. If I could change just one thing though, it would be to have an (optional?) confirmation screen when selecting level up upgrades because it's easy to fat finger the wrong thing."
Will Kaufman,2023/04/24,3,"Unsatisfying meta: Pretty straightforward rouge-lite arena shooter that stands out because of the gear and skills you can use every run, and the constraints of each character. But if you're not winning runs, you're don't ulock a ton or make anything that feels like permanent progress. And you NEED to have certain stats really high to beat the boss, which can come down to luck. Unless maybe you're playing w/ a controller instead of less accurate touch controls? Anyway, meta feels light and slow."
Ahead What,2023/05/11,3,"The update made the game much more enjoyable. Nice job on the fixes. However, these are some bugs I have seen so far: Arms Dealer does not get a guaranteed weapon choice during rerolls as intended. The looter still does not drop crate 100% of the time. The spitter seems to shoot its projectile noticeably faster than its PC counterpart. Land mines still spawn on the perimeter. The wave completed and run lost message is missing after a wave ends."
Craig Schnabel,2023/04/27,1,"Great game, but the mobile version is significantly harder in a not fun way due to a few minor differences, most notably no pickup range on fruits. Makes it extremely difficult to pick them up when in need if you need to actually walk directly over it. Edit: on further playing this is a buggy mess that is no more than a frustrating way to waste time then lose for incredibly stupid reasons. Should be ashamed to charge the same price as the pc version, this shouldn't have been released yet!"
Valerio Depino,2023/10/29,3,"Poggy android port. Somehow feels harder than the pc version tho. There are 2 issues that refrain me from giving 5 stars. The pursuer will keep killing you on every melee build, since the knockback of slashes pulls him in the player's face. Second issue is when the player's weapons start to fire: on pc version weapons have a random factor that prevents them from firing all at the same time and on the same enemy, making the gameplay easier, more satisfying and more balanced. Fix it please."
Zachary Halls,2023/11/07,5,"Fun and casual gameplay with progressive mechanics and very simple inventory management. I've not reached wave 20 yet, so I'm not sure if there are any story elements, but the game play is fun, so that's what matters most. Disclosure: I played this game for free via Play Pass."
worldlywonders,2023/10/26,5,"Perfect game to kill some time! Lots of possibilities and variety in runs. There isn't too much depth to it all, but what's there is effective at giving a good gameplay loop. Recommended for those who are fans of games like 20 Minutes Until Dawn and Binding of Isaac"
Cqstle,2023/11/05,5,"Thisato gameato isato amazato! Seriously though, I can't say enough good things about Brotato. Mobile is a little tougher than the PC/Switch version due to touchscreen movement. I wish it would be updated to the current versio, but it's still a blast. If it came out for PS5 I'd buy it again, just like I did with Slay The Spire."
Treigh Grandstaff,2023/09/13,5,Great game but I think I found a bug and it is a weird one play fisherman and take the rock get as many baits as possible and keep getting rocks it happened at round 4 shop I was able to keep purchasing the same rock until I ran out of money and died while in the shop. But besides that this game is amazing I've spent so many hours playing! Definitely worth getting and I'm loving the new characters!
Bora Bozkurt,2023/10/20,3,The game is usually played while waiting for something soo portrait mode could be great and the cloud system doesn't really work I have 2 phones same account but totally diffirent saves. Other than that it's perfect.
Shock -,2023/11/09,4,"Fantastic game, only gripe I have is that my stats get cut off in the shop. My phone in landscape mode apparently isn't long enough to show me my stats; I have a Google Pixel 4a, if they could fix this I'd be very grateful."
Ronald Ragland,2023/10/31,2,"Was a 5 now a 2 l, I don't know what you did but the midboss on lvl 5 difficulty is insanely hard all of a sudden, almost impossible. I have unlocked all chars and weapons so it's not a skill issue especially when you can only pass if the boss doesnt spawn, something changed."
Kobie Pharis,2023/11/05,3,Danger 1-4 are to easy but danger 5 is fun but way to hard. Most of my runs die before round 9. And what's with this new Halloween boss? Round 4 and I'm trying to use streamer and I can't do anything cause of him. I have beaten danger 5 with a couple characters but only on perfect rng luck like getting a mini gun round 6. Expect to lose 97 percent of time. If you don't start perfect restart while you're ahead cause you'll just die anyways. Especially the first mini boss he'll destroy you.
Alex,2023/10/08,5,Movement is trash. They need to give I frames or something to make up for garbage Movement. Not even close to as good as the pc version. Update:10/7/23 huge improvements have been made. It's a lot closer to the PC version. I'm glad I held out and waited for them to smooth out mobile gameplay.
Darrell Mcgee,2023/11/07,4,"very well made but could use some balancing tweaks with the characters and perks. some are character builds are very easy with certain perks, but some seem to be impossible with any combo of perks. otherwise it would be 5 out of 5 for what it is"
Adam,2023/09/13,3,"Pretty dynamic and has variety of playstyles. There is a bug though which makes the weapon description appear after each wave is finished when you enter the shop. Happened before update occasionally but now it got way worse and happens every time. On top of that, it appears every time I reroll in shop."
Nick Carson,2023/11/04,5,"Brotato is really fun. It's simple, and does not require a large time investment to enjoy. I initially got this on Steam for my PC and SteamDeck, and it's performance and replay factor continue bringing me back."
Tyler,2023/10/01,2,"Pretty fun. Game has a few bugs. Knockback just hits enemies towards yourself which unfortunately most melee weapons have knockback innately, and not not many items remove knockback. Turrets and mines from items like to spawn right on the corners of the map most of the time, instead of somewhere useful. Ranged guns work though Also none of those bugs are present on computer, so just bad port I guess"
Nathan eastman,2023/08/24,4,"I would give this game a five star review but there is one small thing keeping me from doing so. That one thing is an item called the baby gecko. For those of you who don't know the baby gecko has different stats on the computer. It gives a 20% chance to instantly pick up an item, and also increases range. On mobile however instead of giving that extra range, they instead made it so it gives you a -1% life steal. I know it's not a big deal, but I would like the stats to be the same as computer."
Scott Johnson,2023/09/18,4,"Good port from the PC version with differences in the mechanics: - Knockback can hit enemies into you. - Ricochet effects appear to be not random, rather next closest available target making it less effective. - Weapon hit calculation appears different. Of 6 weapons, if 1 would calculate as a kill, other 5 still shoot it instead of acquiring a new target. - Kills seems to calculate before fire effects are applied making elemental spread much worse. Harder, less fun though."
alec man,2023/08/28,2,"I love this game, it's one of the most complex game of this type where you can do so many different types of build. but, the butcher elite on wave 11 just doesn't make runs fun. no matter how well you're doing, you're just going to have your run ended because of how broken it is. I have looked online about it and it seems like a lot of players on mobile share the same sentiments about it and for a long time already and they haven't done anything to balance that elite. cloud saves broken still."
David Yates,2023/08/24,2,"I enjoy this game. However, it's far too hard. The waves just become impossible. I haven't played the pc version, but I bet it's a lot easier. This version has endless mode, where as thr free version doesn't. But it's impossible to pass wave 20, so I feel I wasted my money."
Redemption Jame,2023/09/12,2,"Fantastic game but you need to fix the knock back issue on mobile PLEASE. Melee weapons with knock back will knock enemies into the player instead of away from them. It makes doing runs with wrenches or any other sweeping melee weapon near impossible. Also the Butcher needs to be nerfed on mobile badly, you can't stutter step like you can on PC so almost every character needs to build high speed or intense defense to stand a chance on T5 wave 11, it makes it hard to have unique builds."
Aleksandras Pancerovas,2023/10/01,2,"The boss that has 2 cleavers or whatever and a white hat before still is too strong. She spawned at wave 12 on Difficulty 5 and just destroyed me, her attack cooldown is nearly impossible to dodge, if u do dodge it u get destroyed by the other enemies, and the cooldown of her attack is too short. Nerf her please or leave her at wave 20 or something. Good thing though is that in like 20 runs i have encountered only once now, instead of 8/10 times before."
Adam Mal√Ω,2023/09/29,4,"I have played the Steam version and I gotta say it's fun game. I only played one game of this mobile version but the first problem I saw was with after wave shop when you keep having your item selected and it's quite hard to get rid of it (unselect), it covers like 1/3 of the shop screen"
Jonah Anderson,2023/08/20,5,"cool game. have it on PC (steam), good there too. recommend playing with a controller, dual shock 4 is my favorite and works great with this game and my phone. great amount of unlocks and challenge, good replayability, style similar to TBOI and other edmund games, great & engaging time waster. good stuff! more than worth 6 dollaz <33"
Jake Neutz,2023/10/30,4,"Generally fun to play, but engineering builds on mobile are nearly impossible right now. All turrets spawn on the map walls like 25% of the levels and make it extremely difficult to survive."
Stephen Furlong,2023/10/29,4,"Hello, app maker. With this most recent update it has broken a few things. I am having trouble getting turrets to spawn using the wrenches. 4 out of 10 times they aren't spawning on the map."
Jonathan,2023/09/05,5,Game now runs with the current patch and all the bugs that were ruining my experience before are fixed. Is now a full and proper port of the PC version with all the QoL features. Runs great and controls well for a mobile game. Rating updated to 5 stars.
Jameson Wright,2023/10/19,5,It's a good game for what it is a decent amount of content as a roguelike should have definitely one of my favorites. It has simplicity but also depth and action enough to where it keeps your attention.
A Google User,2023/10/05,3,"A nice little time waster. Knows what it wants to do and does it well. Pro tip: If you want mines to be more effective, play with Engineer. Otherwise, the mines spawn mostly on the edge of the map."
Nathan Dorhofer,2023/09/09,5,"With the difficulty adjustable in the options menu, it gives you a good variety of brainlessly shooting hordes of monsters and challenging stat prioritization. Lots of fun."
Alexander John Velasco,2023/10/14,4,Almost the same as the Steam version. Add a vertical / portrait orientation to allow 1-handed play and it will be perfect!
Simon,2023/08/23,4,"very good execution, I'd like to see custom sensitivity for the controller and also an option to lock it in a fixed position to be implemented, other than that I am very satisified with the game"
Asa Phillips,2023/11/10,5,"love it, I tried the. free version as well, but this one is a better fit for me. I hate microtransactions and having none available feels awesome."
Chris M,2023/11/05,5,"Great roguelike, and an excellent mobile port. My only critique is that the game offers 0 explanation of its mechanics. Would be awesome to see some sort of guidebook added."
Eli Owens (Kyle),2023/10/26,5,"Its not what i thought i seen yt play it on pc and when i seen it was coming to mobile i knew i should preorder i was late on this one (premium) and i thought since i had no money for it i should wait for the free one and tbh it seems better i bought this when i had the chance since its premium i might get the vip extra choise with it, NOPE it took away the option and theres no ingame currency it seems like a ripoff if your careful with your money don't get this one get the free one."
Brendan Neufeld,2023/10/24,5,"Great game, fun to play while offline. One thing I would like to see is an enemy section in the hand book."
Jonathan Ireland,2023/11/02,5,"One mobile game I have and can really play! Super fun, haven't played on Steam yet, thought it wouldn't be fun but I love it!"
Konope,2023/08/21,3,"Honestly, I'd give this game 5 stars on PC. The issue is the game is not balanced for mobile. The red line attacks are astronomically more difficult to dodge on the phone. Precision and accurate movement is awful with touch green joysticks. Red line attacks on mobile should be adjusted for this with a longer delay before damage. If that were adjusted and balanced for mobile, I could give 5 stars. Love the game, just think it needs a bit different balancing compared to pc."
Callum Aitken,2023/08/24,4,"Love the game, but cloud save just does not work between devices. This needs to be fixed. Troubleshooting says to log in to Goole Play Games, I have the green tick, but still just does not sync saves"
Oliver CATON,2023/08/13,4,"Great game, I've had loads of fun on it. It's worth the price, but i do have some issues with it, amd its free counterpart. The free version has many more features, including a whole talent card thing that is nowhere to be seen in this game. As well as a money system called supds. That allows you to purchase characters. I'm very curious why the free version has more features as we paid for this game."
Matt Delarosa,2023/09/12,2,Very fun game...but I wish there was a way to import progress from the non-premium version of the game. If that was available I would give it 5 stars. I have sunk hours into the other version and would recommend this game to anyone with some time to kill.
matthew styles,2023/07/31,4,Great but fustrating after mastering the steam version. Because of the controls for touch screen the elite attacks need to be wider or just balanced better. Touch screen can preform the tight precision controls needed to dodge. Also weapon tag system doesnt seem as good. It feels bad coming in not losing a run on steam in like months then coming here and getting wrecked by an elite in 2 hits.
L'Ri Talent,2023/08/20,3,"it's good as always, but i would like the option for multiple controls like in PC, where u can choose to aim at any moment, my right thumb could do that XD... also i think is not yet at the same development as the PC one, for example: there's no fisherman potato..."
Dominium,2023/07/01,5,"Great game. It just gets pretty stale after a few weeks. Really hate that the pc version always gets the better updates on every game, too. Pc currently has several new characters that we just have to wait on. I know it takes time to develop updated content for different platforms. It would just be nice to see a single game prioritize mobile for once. Other than my gripes it really is a well put together game, and I look forward to seeing new content in the future."
T J,2023/08/14,1,"Cash grab. This is nothing like the Steam game! On PC this is a 5 star game. This version is crazy difficult compared to PC...I've lost about 0/30 on PC and lost roughly 55/60 on mobile. Wave 20 on mobile is about as difficult as Wave 40+ on PC. This is not a control issue. The mobs move about 3 times as fast, always seek you out, and the bosses are comically unbalanced. If the difficulty resembled that of PC, or if unlocks occurred at Wave 10 then this would be a 5 star game. Shamefully priced."
tristan zimmerman,2023/11/08,4,"i started this on the free version and even paid for the ""freemium"" and love thei game but would really love if you could get my progress switched over to this one"
Mason Brogdon (TheMasonJar),2023/10/15,2,A very good timekiller game but it has lots of bugs like randomly my gun will stop shooting or the sound will stop or I will die randomly in the shop I have a screenshot of me dying in the shop
JAMESBFPV,2023/08/28,5,I love this game so so much!! Have it on steam and switch and will get it on ps5 if it comes there too!! I have lots of good ideas for even more characters!! Just wish I could reach the right people!! Love Brotato ‚ù§Ô∏è
Sora Udagawa,2023/10/03,4,"Very fun, many mechanics are different from the PC game so the balancing ends up feeling awkward at times, especially the mini bosses."
Steve Wild,2023/08/16,5,"a fantastic little gem ,easy too play and hard to put down with high addiction level. Edit this still blows me away if only all phone games were paid it would sort out a lot problems."
Alex Schiller,2023/08/18,5,Mobile version is always a little behind the desktop version but still worth the money. Appreciate the devs working hard to get it caught up. Great game.
Benjamin Bruun,2023/08/20,5,This game is super but the latest patch introduced a bug that ends the run after finishing the wave and your shopping for items and weapons. Frustrating to lose twice a d5 run after late game because of that.
shinjuvi (ShinJuvi),2023/09/10,2,Currently unplayable on Retroid Pocket 2+ due to the weapon description taking up half the screen on end of first wave. Latest update seemed to have caused this.
Nicholas Hartje,2023/09/24,5,"got tired of the ads and went premium, so far more stable and seems more like a skill based version of the free one."
Arnold Yap Cabrales Jr.,2023/08/16,1,Friendly advice to those who wish to buy this game. Don't. They won't fix their 4 months bug that gives real irritation. -5 stars they don't even check the reports about the bugs at all.
Michael Scherm,2023/07/02,2,I tried the free mode and was happy but the premium version has so many bugs! I often don't get any material after a wave and my screen is sometimes full with the information of items as if I was hovering over them with no way of closing the window. Instead of adding new content the game show be polished first!
Blake Cressman,2023/06/21,5,"I love this game, Its a really fun time killer, i like how i can start and stop when i have time and it'll save my run. It would be nice if we could figure out what enemy's do what such as the little ball dudes with the weird little growths or the little dude with the bone. Other then that, no issues üòÅ"
Kelli McAllister,2023/06/27,3,"Fun buy is way to hard. Unlockable, characters only make things more difficult, and only 1 weapon is viable early game, the sub machine-gun, that by late game even fully upgraded is useless, and you basically have to have at least 3 rocket launchers to do any damage. Need to tone it down, or at the very least give one continue."
Moe Saad,2023/08/10,4,"This game would have 5 stars if it weren't for: 1- the range on fruits is annoying. I literally have to be on the fruit to pick it up 2- beating the game was a serious challenge. But now I unlocked level 2, and that's where it ends. The Butcher just completely ruins me. I read that it's not the same as on the PC 3- I'd tweek it a bit to be a bit easier. The bosses and elites are just ridiculously strong Edit: upgraded to 4 stars. They fixed the range on fruits."
joe stachera,2023/07/13,5,"Brilliant game. I have a bug, though. I can't Unlock -20% speed guy, I've literally tried everything. Hoping the new update will fix, though I've had 2 updates and still can't unlock this character. It's my last character for level 5 difficulty so please fix for me"
Cristian,2023/07/14,5,"I got this on PC, and it was absolutely fantastic! Now I'm on vacation, got it on mobile, and it feels perfect, like the PC version. Great game, good controls, a lot to do, and no annoying adds to waste your time!"
Lazzz,2023/07/16,5,"Brotato is a masterpiece nothing else to be said. Brotato and Vampire Survivors are my two favorite roguelike right now because they are really fun and there's a lot of content. Speaking of content, I wish Brotato mobile would get more and faster updates on the future and maybe add the possibility of adding mods just like in the pc üôè. Besides the occasional buggy achievements, this game is really recommendable."
Richard Cline,2023/06/22,5,"Value, Balance, Replayability. Initially, it just had a single track for music, then they updated it with several more great tracks. Some more music from the same composer is the biggest potential upgrade I can think of. As far as cons go, there's honestly nothing I can think of. I'm glad I bought this game, it will always be in my mobile game library. The only other mobile game I can say that about is Slay the Spire. Big props to the devs and congratulations on your success."
Distophic (Distophic),2023/08/19,4,This could be collecting data and funds for the ccp (who knows these days) but goddamn is it fun. Couldn't play with my controller unfortunately.
Ben M,2023/10/12,5,"First phone game I've ever spent money on and it was 100% worth it. Haven't had a single bug or similar, just great gaming. Mad respect to this company"
Ravi Dev Chauhan,2023/10/21,5,Excellent port of the game. Some work needed on UI but the game itself is nice..
Jarrett Sloan,2023/10/27,5,It's been a great time killer. Game had enough variety to keep it interesting after a few runs.
Pontus Malm,2023/07/01,4,5 stars if there was an option to make the screen always pan with the character instead of the panning stopping close to the edge of the map. I've died many times because I didn't see enemies hiding under my thumb while I was hugging the wall.
Matthew Birzer,2023/09/16,5,Very fun. Please update to not let structures spawn on the very edge of the map. Thank you!
Reggae,2023/07/13,5,"One (if not the best) of the best rogielite shooters on the market! Keeps what it promises. It is nearly the same game as the original on PC, only a few updates behind,so the new content takes a bit to be ported, otherwise good port! Definitely worth it's money!"
Tamas Balog,2023/09/23,5,Best rogulike on android at moment but add more content example permanent upgrades or fast play mode where everything 2times faster and option to banish items and weapons from runs please
Malific End,2023/07/14,5,"exactly what I was looking for! reminds me of old crimson wars game on PC, very clean and smooth gameplay, hours of high focus fun. the build and class intricacy is great too, could use a stat tool tip for page 2 stats though"
Cat Tipton,2023/09/13,4,"Good Vamp-like, though I feel like it needs some work on the stage design and music."
Justin Boyd,2023/06/25,1,"Unfair dont buy premium version. The regular version with ads is a much better version of this game it gives you extra things to collect and the ability to watch an add to revive. I bought the premium version, and I would gladly watch a 30-second commercial ad to revive. Both versions are the same game. And if I had known I never would have spent the money"
A Google user,2023/11/05,2,It deviates too much from the PC and Switch version. It could be a lot better.
Taggy,2023/08/17,5,"love this game, definitely worth it, one of my favorite games I've played, and really good replay ability. really underrated."
Lumen,2023/10/16,1,Purchased the game to play offline on holiday in Africa but requires an Internet connection. Why make an singleplayer game require Internet...
El Mi,2023/06/24,4,Lots of non in app purchase unlockables. Satisfying gun sounds. Would be nice if there's a n option to vibrate when taking damage. Sync across android devices also doesn't seem to work very well.
Charles Sims (tim),2023/09/05,4,Pretty good... But needs an update to match the desktop version. Even after the latest update there isn't pocket factory üòï
patrick fr√∏slev,2023/06/28,2,"Was initially really happy with the game until i found out that not all brotatos is available on the premium version. They are available on the ""free"" version, however, now i have to pay the same amount to become a VIP member as the amount i payed for the premium version.."
Robert Smith,2023/08/26,1,The free version first death u can watch 30sec video to respawn not in thus version. I paid to make the game less fun awesome
G_Odu Of the North,2023/06/28,5,"Addictive or Addicting? I dunno, it's one of those. Bought this here, and on pc. Only complaint is that it seems like there are some items missing from this version that are in the full one, but I'm not sure. I give it 5 stars anyway, it's pretty damn good for the price."
Wildan,2023/10/20,1,"Suddenly stuck in ""Checking..."" in the latest version. Please fix it asap! :("
Okrooki,2023/11/08,5,"I didn't expect this game to be so good, a worthy download if your into survival type games."
Val,2023/11/07,2,Bug. Unable to start games as Bull character.
Jared,2023/07/24,2,"Massive downfall is that I paid for brotato premium and lost the ability to continue after dying by watching an ad, not even a free continue before having to watch an ad like most other free games let alone a paid ""premium"" game. Rating will be higher once this has been adjusted"
Satpam Komplek,2023/07/22,1,"Game difficulty spike unreasonably.. Can't even beat Dif 0, this version is not ads based where you can keep reviving by watching ada like the free version. You should adjust the difficulty accordingly.."
Jay Snowden,2023/07/04,3,"Great game, hours of fun. EXCEPT it is hamstrung by some wildly OP boss when you reach higher levels. Half way through your run, no matter how good its going, you will die. gg. Kills the fun and replayability. I heard it's not like this on PC. Devs please fix?!"
Kuroi Kabe,2023/03/29,5,"Played the game on PC first and it seems to be a good port. Most of the content in the original game was ported over, even newer updates. It is a good game to spend some time for long as well as short sessions, because you can just exit the game after a wave and the progress gets saved. New players will have to explore the game on their own, but for that the game is very accessible considering the description of the variables. Besides that there is a lot of variety in chars which is refreshing."
Daniel Ting,2023/10/20,2,Broken by last update. Stuck at checking.
Rami Markus Maunula,2023/09/22,4,Great garliclike that finally runs parallel to the PC version! If I ever see that chef boss again in my life it'll be too soon.
Sean Dwyer,2023/10/21,1,Completely unplayable as melee. I don't understand how it's not just a carbon copy of the steam version. You literally kill yourself by pulling enemies into you.
Damarien Smith,2023/07/23,5,Amazing game with little to no problems. New: for the next update could you be able to choose the songs that play like a playlist.
Corey McCarty,2023/06/23,5,Brotato is a great game I have it for both PC and the phone and normally on a phone controls but they did a really good job formatting it for the phone definitely worth the money hopefully we get the 1.0 update soon!!
Jafar Al-Roubaie,2023/08/15,2,"Love the gameplay but Kishi razer controller controls need a major update. Let me select with the A, let me navigate through the menu with the Dpad. 2 stars since great game but poor kishi integration."
Latham's Toy Box & Toy Review,2023/11/04,5,"So fun,I was sad that I was loosing when I was new,but now I am happy that I am winning and I got to wave 24 on endless more:)"
Da M,2023/05/28,5,"Edit: most of my issues got fixed, nice! Really love the game but there are still some issues with the port: - hitdetection seems of on bosses, especially attack from butcher. Makes runs danager 3+ mostly impossible - fruits don't fly to you when you are damaged, but chests do though. Should be the same as in pc version - save system doesnt work reliably - controls sometimes feel less precise than on pc Overall with these fixes easily five starts!"
Florin Bojedariu,2023/04/01,4,"Great game! Will probably be a 5 stars once they fix some of the bugs (hp pickups not being magnetized when you are missing hp) and optimize some things for mobile (miniboss that appears and that strikes with 4 long slashes feels impossible to dodge with mobile controls, slow down his attack animation a bit so we have the time to react, with a mobile joystick). Other than this, it's a great game and hope the dev will keep supporting it with new characters, maps and other stuff."
error sans error error error,2023/11/09,5,really fun game with cool mechanics! definitely would recommend
Rhyce Pope,2023/09/12,4,"Its decent, but the endless mode isn't really endless it cuts off at wave 27 saying run won üò≠ü§£"
Davin Friggstad,2023/09/14,5,"It's a fun game. I love the creativity and effort. My uncle got my dad and I into this game, and all three of us love the game."
The QLX,2023/09/21,5,Super fun and replayable game with a lot of playstyle variety.
Hrre Grg,2023/09/22,1,If this game was 99 cents i got my moneys worth for the price i paid was a total scam and rip off
John,2023/08/22,5,"Super fun, and tough as hell. Nothing more really needs to be said."
Dexter Spalding,2023/08/17,5,kinda buggy and it's pretty hard to win with anything except the smg but pretty good
Nicholas Hemling,2023/10/11,5,"free was so good, went and got premium just to help the developers"
Jonathan Lockwood,2023/08/30,5,fun! controls a bit cramped on the screen
Mark Gray,2023/08/23,5,super fun game with no silly spamming friends and begging for money.
cole bobo,2023/06/23,5,Great Port!!!! I've played brotato on pc for months i had this to alert me on the drop. They have done great. Just need to get the pc updates faster lol. I'm playing 1.0 on pc and back to beta on mobile.
shandika louren,2023/06/29,3,"Just like the pc but still buggy and often got annoyed by the ui bug on shop where for some reason your weapon window popped up and you cant close it except you buy an item that's hidden behind the ui, combine your weapon or recycle it"
Ben Morris,2023/07/10,5,"hands down the best game in this genre, no other game comes close to the depth. such a simple but deep concept. executed perfectly."
Collin Gage,2023/07/14,2,"Had the brotato that was early release and paid money in game, the this version is released and there is no progress carryover, the money I spent did not transfer. Frustrating for sure."
SkaReKrow GX,2023/08/01,4,"Great game, I really enjoy the challenge. I would like to see skill trees but hey I'm nitpicking here. If I only have 1 gripe it is that this game NEEDS CONTROLLER SUPPORT!"
Ezequiel Z√∫√±iga,2023/06/27,5,I love this game on my Steam deck ...I just realized that it was released on Android!! it was an immediate buy for me...I love that it looks better on my phone since it has a better screen than the one on my deck.
Juan,2023/07/30,5,"They need to put in a with a warning labe.Brotato is highly addictive. If you want to feel good distraction, definitely get the premium"
Henry Barshevsky,2023/07/22,3,"The absolute basic version of the full game. You can't even end a run without exiting the ""app"". Add some functionality before cashing in"
Nick Doumlele,2023/07/25,5,"I saw a couple of YouTubers playing this game (LethalFrag and Jorbs) and it looked fun. I'm enjoying this version of the game, and my razer kishi 2 worked with it right away."
Jesse Garcia,2023/07/12,5,One of the best paid mobile games. Risk of Rain mixed with Vampire Survivor. No P2W and no MTX. Looking forward to the final release update!
AHappy KenyBear,2023/05/09,5,"I genuinely enjoy the game, it's not all care bear like (meaning to easy) it's actually got some difficulties to it and it's really fun, I don't like many mobile games as I'm a PC gamer but when I die between my matches in games I just play brotato and sometimes I even die on purpose to just finish a wave or collect what I need to unlock a new character. There are many pros and cons to the game but other then that, your game is going in the right direction to being a really top rated game!!"
Alessandro Salvati,2023/04/19,3,"Honestly, I don't like this port. I don't get why it got reprogrammed in Unity losing all modding functionality, when you could have just exported for android like the unofficial port did. Also, the game balance is off. WAY off and way harder. I don't get it. We in the forums don't get it. Still, I'm supporting the original developer so I bought it just the same. Please fix at least the balance. It's completely different from the PC version and much less enjoyable."
Satik Rerkdaochai,2023/07/16,2,"Weapon Damage bug V1.3.19 Every weapon has same damage For example At Lv.1 I select SMG that shot 3 damge to an enemy but when I select Laser gun, it shot 3 damge too. Both weapon description show different damge value. Please fix it asap"
Gerhard Hanekom,2023/04/04,5,"I did buy it for my pc some time back but the game did not play, only showed a black screen with the game music playing. Decided to buy it for mobile since I am addicted to these kinds of games. And I don't regret it even once! Just the one hit deaths suck a little bit but with the right build you can get pretty good. 5 star review from me!"
Kevin Guan,2023/08/13,5,Mindless fun in short bursts. Low learning curve. Easy to pick up and put down. Worth the price.
Eric Mason,2023/05/23,5,"Thoroughly enjoying this. Never played the PC version, though I might give it a go. Only thing I wish was different is that there's no character progression. A run that ends at level 15 nets you absolutely nothing. Seems like there's a good opportunity to let you level up the characters or buy outfits or.... just something."
Ludo Pex,2023/03/28,4,"Awesome to see this game coming to mobile, it feels good, runs smooth and is a lot of fun! The only bug I've encountered it that when I changed settings the game runs like it's in slow motion. But a quick restart of the app fixed it (you can continue your run when you quit or restart the app)"
yannick roy fontaine,2023/05/16,4,"Very nice roguelite game. The game rewards the player for building his character intelligently, meaning you must purchase weapons and items according to your character's weaknesses and strengths to succeed. The game is hard but fair. There are a lot of roles that play very differently. I would love to see different game modes in the future."
Soeren Ohlenbusch,2023/07/10,5,"Absolutely love the Steam version, had to get the mobile one as well and wasn't disappointed! It's a blast!"
Daniel Firby,2023/05/23,5,"Brilliant and so addicted. Worth the money, I'd even pay more. But 100% a difficult game to wrap your head around. So many different builds, guns, weapons, characters, enemies and achievements to see and unlock. Reminds me of binding of Isaac or enter the gungueon. Fantastic game and I can't wait for future updates to see what else the developers add."
Froggy6112,2023/07/24,5,Hope to see more content being added to the game. Love it. Suggest more ethereal weapons. Love using those in endless. Great game devs!
Ryan Nygard,2023/07/11,5,"This game feels perfect for mobile gaming, it's like the binding of Isaac but made for mobile. It's great, definitely worth the money"
Matt Bates,2023/07/19,4,"Great game, but has crash and screen orientation bugs, and lags behind steam version."
Nils Stjernstrid,2023/08/17,5,"Very well balanced, fun (and pretty hard) game. Replayability lies in the fact ta √§ that it is hard but it's fun even when you do not win"
Cody Newman (That one guy you knew),2023/08/08,5,awesome rogue-like with an even better weapon system and played a bunch of brotato before buying premium. (very)generally a good game that can take your unused time
davisson lam,2023/07/01,3,"It says update available on 9 Jun 2023 but I'm still not able to get the update, play store shows no update, uninstalling and reinstalling doesn't help."
Grayson Carlyle,2023/05/10,1,"Fun game (on PC*), BUT it pains to see some of the accessability features from the original, non-mobile-version, missing. Such as the slider for enemy health and damage to make the game accessable for some people, while having a way less precise control than on keyboard plus less accurate hitboxes it seems. Makes it more frustrating than it should be."
Jordan Harmel,2023/04/14,4,"Great game, have it on PC as well. Only current issue is that my -20% speed is not unlocking. I've gotten to is several times on a few characters and even beaten the game with much greater than -20%. Winning a run at a lower difficulty say 0 will take away the ability to select difficulties higher that 1 for the next run."
cris cristurean,2023/05/13,5,"Good game but I'm pretty sure that level 2 difficulty boss requires scaling, tried many many various attempts... still no clue how to get boss down more than 50%... Edit 3: awesome game!... devs listened!! I think you went to easy on difficulty scaling as I was able to win with difficulty 4 and 5 first time back to back. Overal Great survival game and looking to start making out the other classes (ranger 1st)"
Kenrick Baughman,2023/07/22,5,"1st decent game with barely any adds, beat the 1st brotato with 1000 spuds with 16 unlock characters its good game honestly runs very smooth never locked up once!"
Dwayne Clark,2023/05/14,4,"3 or 4 stars now (after update). Still not sure. I completed this on PC, and it wasn't that easy there until I was able to adjust settings. The android version has been extra frustrating due to the difficulty level, esp when it comes to the bosses. I was able to complete level 0 with the sniper and the old dude. That's it. Always got to level 20 with somewhat premo weapons etc, but always died. I'm actually using it with my old Samsung DeX stn circa note 8, w little controller success(w s23 ult)"
Mr Felix,2023/05/18,3,"One handed mode and centered on your brotato would be a nice solution. For better view and control, cuz now if the brotato goes under your finger u can't see the location of your brotato.. this is a good game just those minor things. Like give us some level ups (exp) when we play those brotatoes a longer time, with upgrades in perks. Now it's a bit hard even at 0 difficulity. Please fix this.. So where's the big update?"
Dale Dandridge,2023/05/27,5,"Edit: 5 Stars since update. Chef attack pattern is more manageable and still challenging. The quality of life fixes have been improved, only thing missing for me personally is the end wave countdown noise for an audible prompt but all around a closer port from the Steam original. A great game!"
Bryan Lim,2023/05/29,5,"The game is just as fun as the steam version one. but I wish you can change the sensitivity of the movement and maybe have an option to zoom in closer. it feels a little too zoom out. But it's a pretty good port! thanks, and keep up the good work!"
William Johnston,2023/05/22,5,"Love this. Not only one of the best shooter games, but one of the best Android games period. The format works all well, the gameplay of smooth, and it's infinitely replayable due to the difficulty scaling. 10/10"
Dane Kinnear (Bairn O' Nessie),2023/05/23,5,"Devs please don't nerf this game. Difficulty is not a bad thing. I see too many people here complaining 'mobile is harder than pc'. Whoopty-Doo. Play a game that gives you a challenge. Get good. Sure, it can get frustrating, but the pay-off is worth it. Plenty of content. Lots of unlocks. Heaps of replayability. It's not a mindless zombie game, but encourages growth and betterment. Easy 5/5."
Jason Howard,2023/05/19,5,I love the game but there are a few problems or glitches in it and I would like to see them fix. 1 is some I beat level 1 and now I can't try level 2. And the 2 problem is some achievements you do and the it does count it.
Russell Kent,2023/06/13,5,"Hey i love the game i have it on pc and i noticed, that when your damged on pc the fruits fly towards you when your close enough or if its in your pick up range, in the mobile version the fruit dont do this at all, and the boxes which also heal you always do it even with full health. Is this a bug or intented? im unsure Edit: they included most of the features from the pc version still seem to be missing a few weapons but the fruit now is collected if your missing health as long as its in range"
Dung Nguyen Quang,2023/06/09,3,"Mediocre port of a great PC game. The control feel very awkward compare to PC version. The collision also feels off. It's kinda get better after the patch, i couldn't really recommend the game for anyone if it was in the state it first released. But honestly, patch are coming too slow, we still havent catch up with PC version yet."
Patrick Towles,2023/05/04,1,There's some kind of issue going on where I can't access the higher difficulties even though I've already beaten them. I've beaten danger 2 before but now I can only select danger 1 on all characters. Had to change my review to because the game feels incredibly hard on mobile. And a lot of the classes you can't even really beat danger zero with. Unless you get super good RNG. Which is fine but it gets kind of a bummer after a while.
Thiago Dorneles,2023/11/10,5,One of the best survival games ever.
Lei Kervin Divina,2023/04/01,4,"I had a great experience with the mobile version but I have a few issues with it. Firstly is the fact that you can't win with pacifist due to the wave 16 or 17 I believe where the mobs get SUUUUPER FAST like you cannot get rid of them. And then there's the foods and I can't get them with pickup range. Besides that, It's really good. Edit: I forgot to mention that elites and bosses have instantaneous attacks which gives me no time to react at all :("
Tony Gutierrez,2023/11/07,5,Awesome game super smooth great for killing time
Hayoung Lee,2023/07/15,4,Amazing update but there's a bug with Jack not unlocking. I've cleared bosses and elites in under 15 seconds multiple times on D5
Jarden,2023/05/06,4,"Pretty hard game but I enjoy that. Need to cater to mobile a little better and maybe have the arena sit a little upwards off centre. When you're being chased into the bottom left hand corner you're completely blinded by your own hand. Also, seeing as the movement is a bit iffy, could you change the heal drops to magnetize toward the character- it's a bit sad when you make a risky weave through enemies to heal, succeed, but realize you didn't heal because you didn't walk over the fruit perfectly"
Jrom Gaming,2023/04/06,1,"Fun and challenging, but I think this game's balance and difficulty needs more fixing, otherwise it's almost impossible to get pass difficulty 2 with the enemies becoming suddenly fast, strong, and durable at later waves then killing you instantly like your upgrades are useless. I like the challenge but being set to lose doesn't make it worthwhile."
James Maire,2023/05/11,5,Brotato>Survivor Io. It's an amazing game but there are issues like every game. This desperately needs more updates and content. More weapons and upgrades. There is also a very frustrating bug. There is a challenge where you must reach -20% speed. No matter what speed you get to. It doesnt work. You can't get a certain character. I'm really excited to see further updates and more content.
D3NB0 0,2023/05/09,4,"There is one really annoying bug in this port version of brotato... I played through til danger 4.... Now i completed a run with the brawler on danger 1 and now when i want to start a new run on a higher difficulty, the highest i can select is danger 2, no matter the character... Wich basically means: If you complete a run on a lower danger than that you already unlocked, your danger progress gets screwed!!!! And there is a diffrent bot behavior/buffing etc than on the pc version....."
Phoenix Cast,2023/07/11,4,I did find a glitch in the game...if you make a new game exit but save the game and renter you can skip a wave.
NookLite,2023/05/24,4,"I would like this game more if it had more reason to play like give us a currency system that you get by getting to far waves and you can spend on things like cosmetics, like backgrounds or weapon skins because right now the point of playing is to have fun, which I mean IS fun I'm having a blast but once I get every character I'm going to get bored of this game."
Ryan Pettit,2023/03/31,5,"I initially put 4 stars due to the touch controls being a tad clunky. And while they are a bit, the devs seem dedicated to updating and optimizing the UI as well as controls for mobile. I also have started to get used to the touch controls and am getting the hang of it now. All in all I would say that Brotato is quite possibly the best game to have graced the mobile gaming platform with its presence. If you like rougelikes - Brotato is for you If you like casual games - Brotato is for you"
Joe,2023/04/19,5,"Good balance, lots of characters, and HUGE amount of build diversity keeps each run interesting. Much more than ""faster speed less damage"" or ""more money less health"". Every character feels like a different way to engage with the arenas, you'll be adjusting your gameplay dramatically each time. Death comes swiftly but feels fair. Game is challenging - be very surprised if you win your first few runs, don't be discouraged when you die. Try many different characters."
Milieu,2023/07/08,1,Stop popping up asking for a rating. Every single time I'm in the shop wanting to buy something even after I've X'd out of it.
milos markovic,2023/04/22,4,"Great game, but demon is bugged and takes random damage which usualy kills you, -20% speed character doesnt unlock when you reach -20% speed. When you unlock higher difficulties they dont stay permanently unlocked, you have to reunlock them if you return to a lower difficulty. Also you have to run over fruit to pick them up insted of them being picked up by your pickup range while not at full hp. And it would be great to update the game to the current pc patch."
Jason Oliver,2023/06/04,1,I truly regret purchasing. Difficulty way to high (Bugs don't help). Doesn't play like computer version. Very disappointed. Update... Might just be the worst game ever. Please don't waste your time(or money) on a trash app version .
Laith Harrington,2023/10/30,5,great and amazing games can honestly find a complaint
Magnus ferm,2023/11/02,5,One of the best games available for Android.
Tomas Pliksnevicius,2023/11/10,5,"Love brotato, well made and really fun!"
Aaron Huff,2023/11/03,5,very fun arcade style game
H BN,2023/10/20,3,"V1.3.51 is broken, stuck on ""checking..."" load screen."
Rika ‚ÄúSmiling Exile‚Äù,2023/10/21,5,Updating from my previously updated review; game works again and I'm back having fun with it uwu
Hugh Ridgway,2023/11/03,5,"Great game, and a generally good port,"
MathewWM,2023/11/08,5,Incredibly deep. Worth double the price.
Erich Raybon,2023/11/07,5,good game it's really good because it is a good offline game
Edvin,2023/09/19,5,Most buggs are fixed. Updates from PC added. Good game. (Updated review).
yasen Kirov,2023/10/20,5,I want warhammer 40k space marine character and fun mode where you remove all the limits on everything
Keneise Hibo,2023/04/30,4,I've bought the game which cost way more then it's PC version with way less features. It's a good game. I just hope future updates are made. Rates it 4 not 5 cuz I feel like there is a need to for something more Innovative like each difficulty level can change the looks of the maps. Maybe an endless mode with an endless map which has several obstacles.
Koala ‚ÄúCool-Ala‚Äù Bear,2023/09/24,4,Doesn't save progress properly between installs
Andrew Wagner,2023/04/26,5,"Love it, very challenging, but fun to repeat. I am having an issue with enemies speeding up real fast for no reason, usually around lvl 13 and up, which seems like a bug. Hopefully it gets fixed, but fun game either way."
Nikita Sizov,2023/04/29,3,"The game is currently unbalanced. Fast projectiles, high damage. No overall progression like in vampire survivors. Every mistake is punishing for a player. Difficulty levels are insane - devs, check your analytics and see how many players passed the 2nd or first stage. No descriptions for stats, how am I supposed to understand what does harvesting mean? As an idea - add progression for each character and give players ability to increase stats for all characters. And fix difficulty please!"
joshua turnage,2023/04/05,4,Love it. No complaints about bugs or difficulty here. But I do hope it doesn't take long to catch up with the amount of content in the pc version. Right now the run variety is decent but the pc version is league's above in replayability.
Jonathan Richardson,2023/04/03,1,Something isn't right. Have tried tons of runs and combination but can't clear 0 with any character. Have done multiple clears on PC without using any of the accessibility features. I honestly can't pin point it but something is off. Also have had a number of achievements not pop when passing the stats required.
Noah Havens,2023/05/07,1,"Lot of bugs in the code from bringing it to mobile it seems, as the ""max difficulty"" beaten resets every time you beat a difficulty. So I beat Dif2 with Ghost then Dif0 with another character for achievements, then have to rebeat Dif1 and 2 to unlock 3 or get the highest difficulty text back to the same. And i agree with others that this seems harder than normal due to enemy/code changes. Can't even attempt to beat Dif2 with anyone but Ghost bc of the speed and damage of enemies. Please fix this"
Jon Love,2023/04/11,5,"More than meets the eye... at first glance, just another survivor type game, albeit with cutesy graphics. It is much deeper than that with your progression tree forcing you to choose between upgrades for your armour or increase the range of your shots. Each decision affects how your titular spud performs. Melee weapons? Check. Ranged weapons? Also check. Manic gameplay in perfect 1 minute bursts combined with very satisfactory sound effects. Highly recommended. 5 Gold Stars!"
Paulo Correia,2023/04/04,2,"As an avid player of the steam game this mobile port is very frustrating and hard to enjoy. I don't understand why you changed the fundamental mechanics of fruit and box pickup ranges. You have to literally step on the fruit to grab it even when low HP, making it too risky to even get near it sometimes. On the other end of the spectrum, you changed the box so it gets picked up from far, whether you have full HP or not. Don't see myself playing this mobile port much, it's not enjoyable I'm afraid"
Corey Hokanson,2023/04/14,3,"The game is 5 stars! Except some bugs. Namely, every time I open the game it locks me out of everything over danger 1 and I have to unlock the higher difficulties again - despite already clearing a danger 4 run & having that achievement unlocked. Also the speed -20% achievement doesn't work."
Mil√°n M√≥dos,2023/03/28,4,"I really want to give this game a 5*. I have played countless hours on Steam with it, but on mobile its lagging so much.. its like playing in slow motion. Other then that the UI is very good the game looks sharp, and its the full game that you find on PC. If they manage to make the game run smoother I will correct my rating to 5* no time. **Im using a Snapdragon 8 gen2 phone so its not my phone thats the problem here**"
Tommy Walton,2023/03/31,4,Wish I could give it a 5*. Great game overall. Only come across 1 bug. When the enemies come out that buff others it's like they match the player movement. Like instead of buffing the enemy they glitch the enemy and it starts matching the player movement in every direction.
Matthew Andress,2023/04/11,5,"This game is just as fun as pc just without the mods. When I bought the game on pc I thought it would be a fun mobile game, and I was right only issue is the controls sometimes it goes the wrong way but other than that no complaints from me. Keep up the great work."
The Jokebrandt,2023/04/02,1,"Would be a great game if it weren't for those 1 hit deaths. I have no way of dodging enemies sometimes because there are too many chargers and those things that shoot red orbs. I always get 1 shotted by those enemies and it's driving me crazy. It also takes waaaaaay too long to beat a level. I have been playing for like 4 days and have barely managed to beat 1. Given how many characters there are, I immediately lose motivation to continue playing."
Deividas K,2023/04/14,4,"An eye-pleasing and challenging game, with a multitude of characters and items making every run fun! However, higher difficulties are impossible to complete on mobile, as mobs are not balanced compared to the PC version. I would wait for further balance patches before committing."
Steve Wignot,2023/04/15,3,It's OK and will likely be better in future version. Skill is somewhat irrelevant as you're not going to win without extremely lucky rng. The negatives of the character classes are drastically worse than their positives which doesn't so much add a challenge as it makes them not worth playing (see previous comment about rng). Definitely needs better scaling/balancing and a permanent equipment system.
Simon Huesmann,2023/04/10,5,"Great game on PC, ported to Android. The app on this platform is not perfect, yet but will probably get better as it is early days. Scaling and control can be improved. Apart from that, the game is great fun and makes one addicted without any ingame purchases. Just plain old skill based progression!"
Tom,2023/04/10,5,"Love the art, strategy, pacing, variety, just not enough content to be ""premium"" yet. Suggestions: More gamemodes (endless?). Different maps + exploration. Mini-boss waves. More breakable objects. Permanent grindable currency for player cosmetics, map visuals, monster design etc. Functional pets: auto-loot, heals, projectile blocking, tree breaking, enemy taunt, stat boosts. Taking damage needs sound/vibration. Manually placeable barriers/traps/turrets. Triggerable character abilities. Potions."
Jake Kozusko,2023/04/22,2,"Way to hard in my opinion, haven't even won a single run of 20 on the easiest difficulty and Iv done over 12 different runs with different builds. Not much to work for since their are no permanent upgrades. Overall a waste of time. 20 minutes till dawn or vampire hunter's is far better with a similar format. This game was poorly designed by lazy developers that I assume are masochistic and enjoy failure when playing games, I wish i could get my money back."
GuardianGage,2023/05/10,4,I love the game but it is very buggy still. I have lost my progress for some reason and am unable to access the higher difficulty settings. But the game is still a new port. I will follow up on a review after they had time to fix issues.
Tim T,2023/04/27,1,"Game is extremely buggy compared to the PC version including several game-breaking bugs. It has been out almost a month with a few minor patches that didn't address the major bugs, and devs (via their Discord) have stated they're focusing on new content rather than bug fixes. I've played this a lot and enjoyed it, but the bugs are frustrating and at this point unforgivable. My recommendation is to avoid for at least a few months and check back to see if bugs have been addressed."
Morgan Null,2023/04/19,5,"Love this game. Tons of potential builds, fast paced, tons of items and weapons to chose from. Only thing I would add is the ability for permanent Stat increases as a reward for clearing, or maybe a level system for each potato to increase their passive traits? Other than that, 5/5 easily"
Jeremy Wallace,2023/04/10,5,"Having so much fun playing this and the fact that you can play on your phone is perfect. If you're a fan of rogue-likes then this is a no brainer. Tons of characters with unique play styles. Lots of things to unlock. Great build variety. Overall, an amazing game."
Maxson Green,2023/05/04,1,"Amazing game but really needs controller support. A game this frantic really needs better than on-screen joystick. Edit 5/3/23: Reducing my rating to one star because the game has a mid-boss known as the Butcher that is improperly balanced on mobile making him an instant run-killer. This is unacceptable in a paid game. I love the title overall, but I'm leaving this at one star until this is patched."
Patrick W,2023/04/01,5,Played 50 hours on original pc version then saw they released mobile. Addicted. This port is SO good. Devs knocked it out of the park with the optimization. Runs super well with no hiccups. Only issue is dodging projectiles with mobile controls is harder than pc and so a lot more runs are difficult to finish.
Marc Russell,2023/03/30,5,"After initial hiccups the cloud saving looks to be working after an uninstall and reinstall to the new version. Game is great, levels are not to long and not to short and has a good art style. Kudos to the devs for fixing the issues."
Anthony Vieira,2023/03/31,4,"Fun game but with one issue. Something felt off about the movement and then I realised, the virtual joystick has zero dead zone in the middle so it makes changing direction jarring. Please add a dead zone and allow us to adjust it."
Isaac Shin,2023/05/06,5,"In an alternate fantasy universe where Mr. Potato head and his bros must fight the aliens to defend what is theirs...xD All jokes aside, this game gives you different challenges with each difficulty level. Once you've got a grasp on the weapons & functionality, it becomes a sort of puzzle game to figure out how to min/max a build (using attribute points) to bring out the full potential of the weapons. Customize your own experience between offense & defense and have fun ^^(is that an alien dog??)"
Muhd Mahfuz,2023/04/21,3,I think you need to make screen wideness customable bcs this ain't like pc one... Pc you have big screen make you able to predict the distance but for phone i think the camera way to high make it bit harder to predict if the enemy distance... I think that the only flaw i find ... Other thing all good only camera high make it customable...
Daniel Liptrot,2023/04/06,4,"Great game. The mobile port runs really smoothly on my prehistoric V30. There's a few bugs right now which are a bit too impactful to ignore and the controller support isn't complete, but it looks like the devs are on to it."
Christopher Coonan (Reali-tGlitch),2023/03/28,5,"Huge fan on PC. Very tight, satisfying, sound design. Ridiculous builds. Lots of fun. Absolutely one of the best of the action survival genres (which Vampire Survivors helped revitalize, but is one of the oldest in gaming."
louis joseph-lowery,2023/05/02,5,"Great time killer steam game that has more depth than you'd expect. So far the movie pretty is smooth and plays well. I wish there was some way to choose the zoom level, it's a little too far zoomed out to me."
Hughman Case,2023/03/30,4,Great game but cloud storage doesn't work. I am online. I checked play games app and it shows the game in my profile but still when I load the game on settings cloud storage is showing a red X. EDIT to dev: I've done what you suggested prior to posting the review. I'm not dumb of course I know it needs to be online. I already said I am online in the original review. You have a problem with your servers or the game.. fix it.
Fasyle,2023/05/13,4,"Early access game have a tendency to be buggy, not unexpected. Would like to see more stage variety and an Endless game mode. Also was affected by the bug that resets your max difficulty level down to 1."
James T,2023/04/16,3,"Played a number of reverse bullethell games, but there just isn't much here. It's like a 00's Newgrounds version of Binding of Isaac with no direction, no goal, just variables that let you kite in a circle for a little longer. I can do ""make your own fun"", just not in Brotato. ü§∑"
Caiden King,2023/08/30,5,Great game good game play loop can get repetitive after hours of play but it's more meant for short bursts of play time
Mikhail Bogdanov,2023/05/06,1,"Core idea is nice, but execution is not so good. Bugs (including the worst one - losing your saves) and missing some basic features (e.g. knowledge base). After looking at other reviews I got a feeling that this poor port is a simple cash grab / scam and deva are not going to fix it. So, avoid this trash"
Michael Trent,2023/06/21,1,"Love the Game. Sadly , two updates ago it broke and no longer launches on my Pixel 7 Pro."
Jason Stewart,2023/03/31,4,Fun game so far. Finally fixed cloud save issues so now it won't get reset everytime. Nice variety in weapons and upgrades. Would like to see a little more variety to keep things interesting.
Jerry Wang,2023/08/02,3,"Please fix range weapons like crossbow, it's always focusing on the same enemies."
Nate W,2023/07/12,4,this is a great game to play in your down time. bonus points if you connect a controller.
Atul Jose,2023/05/18,3,"Decent port from Godot to Unity. However, several things need fine tweaking to match the feel of the pc release, it feels too difficult and unbalanced. This version of the game is not fun"
Emil Harvig -,2023/08/25,5,Best game both on PC and mobile!
Kim Crawford,2023/10/20,1,"With the latest update, Brotato Premium won't load past the checking screen."
Shrimply Pibbles,2023/08/28,5,"it's not as good as PC but it's still top tier for mobile, period. 10/10"
Evil Souls,2023/08/04,1,"Worst game of it's kind wish I could refund the junk. Smallest maps I have ever seen, trash."
Brandon Boothroyd,2023/04/19,4,"I've put about 40 hours in, only thing holding back 5 Stars is full controller support. I can control the brotato but choosing any upgrade Is done touch screen. Edit: New patch made me loose my clear progression. I beat 0 and 1 and had 2 available but this new patch took 2 away."
Christopher Reyes,2023/07/22,4,Its cool sometimes game doesn't make sense like i was playing demon bought stuff in store health wouldn't update so i died when i started but i choose a new character and then it put me back to the next level for demon
Rey-game,2023/06/13,4,"I rated 4 because the BGM not looping, its mildly annoying for me personally. The rest of the gameplay is good and reasonably balanced (not perfect, but hey, nothing is perfect)."
Heidi Champion,2023/05/14,3,Just like the PC version - good game. But are you going to add the same customizable options in the mobile version? Lowering or raising difficulties of specific things?I figured with the cost it would at least include this. Will it be implemented?
Matt Weaver,2023/04/07,5,"I adore this game. I play a lot of this reverse bullet hell games (or whatever you want to call it) and this one is my favorite. The diversity of strategies is immense, the fun twists they do with all of the classes are great. I can't recommend this game enough if you like this genre."
John Fizzelo,2023/08/18,5,Get this one. Don't even bother with the free version. It's P2W trash.
babis hatred,2023/05/17,2,"Why we lose the progress? Completed the 4th difficulty and now I'm back to 0. Uninstalled and got fixed after second instalation. Today the same again. Did the same steps, uninstall/install, difficulty back to zero. Sorry, did all the updates, even the last fix for the premium version did not help."
Bryan Schaefer,2023/10/07,5,"Very Fun, especially if you enjoy other rougelikes"
I am Mrodgers,2023/08/16,5,"Please give us more mods for premium version. At least GMO, but really just give us the mods and let's us choose from them to apply? You would get more people staying on the game for longer with more to do. I for one would love to run some Loud GMO runs into endless :)"
Dakota George,2023/04/01,2,Would give a 5 star if certain achievements such as having -5 regen and -20 speed worked. Have had -42 speed and didn't unlock the achievement and had -9 regen without unlocking achievement. If they worked toward this instead of answering every review about cloud saves its an easy 5 star
Matteo van Zwieten,2023/05/14,5,"Game is fun, but data loss occurs very frequently. This mainly happens when you close the app shortly after completing a game, or unlocking achievements. This happens consistently and it is very annoying because it is so difficult to progress."
Sekiro's Shadow,2023/04/02,5,"Awesome Rougelike , saw a German YouTuber play it on steam and instantly had to buy it. I have one Problem tho, I'm not sure if it's intentional , but sometimes the higher danger Lvs are locked , even on characters I already completed them with. Still a 5* game and well worth it's price"
Essbjorn,2023/05/09,4,Went down from 5 to 4 stars because after a patch I lost the ability to do harder difficulties. I've done danger 3 or 4 but can only chose danger 0 or 1. My mage character has the red background for example but can't chose danger 3/4 still.
Evan Kirk,2023/11/08,5,10/10 best mobile game
Nursyafiq Razali,2023/04/28,3,"For now 3 stars due to several bugs (i got one shot with 100 hp + 20 armor) at danger 0 on this patch. But able to grind to danger 3 with previous patch (along with different bugs before, somehow i manage). Very frustrating when u go 30 mins completing your build and got one shot bug"
Taylor Hintze,2023/11/02,5,best game on mobile period
Stu Kendrick,2023/10/05,5,"Fun game, just like the PC version!"
Two Wheels,2023/09/03,5,Simple but very fun game
PumpkinSlayer,2023/08/27,5,Bro I die so much danger 5 is ridiculous.... AND I CANT STOP PLAYING 10/10
Alex Fielding,2023/08/22,1,"Fix freaking opened tooltips already please, how long may it take?"
Mitchell Aiken,2023/10/03,5,It's phenomenal and it matches the steam version!
Cyfr Degenero,2023/10/05,5,fun and runs smooth
Samantha Seeger,2023/09/01,5,It's so good ü§óbut when will the gutlet be comeing
I Putu Sedana Wijaya,2023/09/09,5,Worth to buy if you play game for fun
Old School rpg,2023/04/04,4,"Really fun bullet heaven type game. Kind of difficult, but fun. I still haven't completed a single run and there's not much explanation of what all the stats and pick up actually are."
Ol' Scruffy,2023/08/10,5,"Endless mode, no ads, so many builds. Worth it."
Peter Reid,2023/07/12,5,Love the simplicity yet complex choice's for every one! great game!
Lamon Smith,2023/08/09,3,if it had a survival mode were you go intell you die instead of a limit of waves i will rate it better
Tean Wan,2023/08/01,2,Level 11 on higher difficulty pretty much guarantee spawns a butcher and ends 90% of runs.
Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Tr∆∞·ªùng,2023/07/28,4,"Please update new version. I found so many bugs with demon, which is my favorite botato."
Dylan Vatomatic,2023/07/02,5,Perfect if you liked the PC version and it has controller support
Mohamad faez Mohamad talaad,2023/06/22,5,Easy to play but hard to master..admire those who managed to pass danger 5..
Cameron Creach,2023/08/12,3,Great game but menus on weapons get stuck on and it makes it unplayable
A Pennington,2023/07/07,5,"100% worth the price, endlessly entertaining and satisfying."
Nate Pratt,2023/07/08,4,"many bugs, behind on updates. Still excellent."
KILLSMASH,2023/07/23,5,Great game. Feels more difficult than on pc though.
armelec,2023/06/23,1,"Love the game, bought premium. Rated 1 star because spams me every game to rate it on here."
Omar,2023/07/06,5,best mobile game I've played. I usually don't rate but this game is fun an addicting. would recommend it
Dusty Brannon,2023/07/20,5,Super fun game! I can get my brotato fix at home on the pc and on the go on mobile now!
James Steven,2023/07/01,5,Addictive and Awsome gameplay!! Keep u. The great work
david Atwell,2023/05/02,2,"Ive had some bad luck runs where ive stuffed up, but it doesnt matter what i have, its impossible to get past level 20, ive maxed out most of the weapons in a run, had range builds that obliterate level 19 even, dodge, life steal, high hp, armour. It doesnt matter. Still havent made it past the 1st boss. Closest ive gotten it is to about half health with 2 red rocket launchers, a red shotgun, a red smg, a purple smg and a purple minigun. Range damage thru the roof... still no"
Damian Butler,2023/04/02,5,Great game. Only issues iv found so far is: Unlocking the sick. I got -5 hp regent and it's still not unlocking. There's a bug where even though iv beaten danger level 1. Iv even used the bull. Danger level 2 is still locked for some reason.
Catanic,2023/08/19,1,Item and stat popups constantly show up after each wave and sometimes completely block important part of screen making the game unplayable... feels like a very poor port of the game
Grey,2023/08/09,4,"fun games. needs to stop popping the ""rate us screen"""
rawrdino241,2023/03/30,5,"Very goog game, however I noticed some changes from the PC version first I keep on reaching the goals of the unlocks but it doesn't give me the character, second it's harder to get weapons."
Craig Engbrecht,2023/07/08,5,"Fantastic Game,I now have it on PC and android."
angel manibusan,2023/03/28,5,"This game is fun. The top down shooter is very fun. I found myself playing for hours. Would recommend to anyone, if you like upgrading your characters and seeing them wear the items."
Justin Harding,2023/05/05,5,"I also have this game on PC and they have a really good loop going with this survival-type game. it mixes in a little super auto pets, round based gameplay that helps with your builds and respects your time; especially on mobile."
Josh,2023/06/24,4,"Really fun game, but needs a portrait mode"
ENTERNAL CARNAGE,2023/09/21,5,I've been wanting this game forever now it's finally on mobile
cathy prentice,2023/07/21,4,it's a very fun game. It just gets hard after a bit
Sam Kraus,2023/06/27,4,"Meta progression that increments power is what makes a game roguelite. This is a roguelike, not a roguelite."
Darin Balser,2023/03/28,5,"Love the game! Bought it on steam and now mobile. Great game on the go or when you got time to burn. Only issue is the cloud saving, there's just a red X and I've tried everything to get it to connect :("
Imants Borodkins,2023/04/11,4,"i do know this is a great game, but it just does not feel right. not sucking in consumables on low health and knockback throwing around enemies randomly (often dirrectly in your path) insted of just pushing them away are my main issues"
steven eliason,2023/05/08,3,"Great fun, has a bug where swung melee weapons will knock enemies into you, causing instant damage. Makes some of the characters almost unplayable."
Franz Fries,2023/08/30,5,"pc ver is better imo, but this is fine"
Ben Hatch,2023/05/20,5,Will adjust my star rating higher when elites aren't over tuned on mobile vs. PC. I can't play past wave 11 on mobile unless I get a horde instead of an elite past danger 2. Haven't had that issue on PC. Update seems better up to 5 now.
Joshua James,2023/05/18,4,Definitely addicting but could use a little bit of fixing! Like having some waves be easier early but harder on the later end! Other than that it's fun
Trevor Gregg,2023/05/30,5,"Great game overall. I have had no issues with the game.It has been really fun to play.There are so many ways to play and new strategies to use everytime you play, so I find myself never getting bored of it."
Tony Schellenberg,2023/06/01,2,"This game is really good. Lots of fun. So, why 2 stars? It's a paid product and it keeps nagging you to rate it without an obvious way to disable the prompts."
Brian Lucke,2023/06/19,4,"A decent but lesser version of the computer version. Still many updates behind & hard to tell when being hit, but fun none the less."
Alexandre lavall√©e,2023/06/05,2,Very poor game design for a premium game. Feels too repetitive and progress feels just dumb. Even for free there are better options in this genre of game
Steph ‚ÄúBiaxialsnake‚Äù Des,2023/05/29,4,Is there any difference between this version and the free one ? At first glance it seems not. Incredible game!!!! Minor adjustments needed like all the other post are saying.
Psych0gamer,2023/05/20,5,"My only complaint is that it tends to get difficult to see/ move around using the current touch controls, maybe implement a different type of control for this?"
Pampoen Koekie,2023/06/16,5,"Quality, fun and truly addictive game! No horrid micro transactions ruining a great game. Learn from this team. Money well spent. Keep up the good work!"
Joe,2023/06/21,5,"Edit: Game is playing awesome! Really loving how it is playing now! Original review: I played the pc version after this one, and it's amazing! I really hope this gets brought up to that same standard"
Aleksandar Rakiƒá,2023/05/26,5,"Fun game, nice timekiller, saves runs when you quit out so no fear of losing a run when you have to take a long break."
Chris Underwood,2023/05/31,3,Decent but shallow game. Decent time sink while listening to audiobooks. Minus one star because the game wouldn't leave me alone until I rated the game. 4 stars is fair without the obsessive review soliciting in a paid game.
Liuv13,2023/05/24,5,"This is the best game I've played on phone in awhile. Plenty of content and goals to aim for, with a very satisfying game loop."
Anton Galica,2023/07/27,5,"awesome lil roguelike, easy to learn, a bit tough to master"
Wei Wei Lee,2023/07/27,5,good game. wish can update as fast as pc version
Alexander Beckett,2023/09/26,5,so awesome fun and quarky
Truth Shockwave,2023/04/27,5,Absolutely fantastic and unique roguelike game (I've played a lot of them) tons of weapons abilities and combinations. Great art and fps. Runs like a potato. I couldn't ask for more!
Chuck Norris,2023/07/31,1,My brother has VIP I got this thinking it was the same due to they both having a premium thing only to find out they're nothing alike!
Joe Jensen,2023/10/14,5,Please add more characters to the game
Albert Wang,2023/06/13,5,Played the PC version in pre release / open alpha. Game is so much more feature rich and even better than before. So happy the devs released a mobile version. Great stuff!
Shun Liang Chen,2023/06/10,4,Additive game!! But I can't sync game save to multiple devices even though it shows green stick.
Mark Rader,2023/08/27,5,worth the 5 bucks. very fun roguelike
Kevin Comfort,2023/05/23,5,It's a fun game I've put many hours into. The devs are releasing new content and patches which is great. I'm a fan!
Andrew,2023/09/09,2,No controller support
Thomas Fjord,2023/07/23,5,Like the mobile games of old. One upfront price
Joe Brereton,2023/09/30,5,fantastic in it's depth for 5$
Circa AD 1975,2023/08/03,5,fantastic...period. I'm tempted to get this on my steam deck!
James Bray,2023/08/06,5,fun little game with no problems seen thus far.
Conor Doyle,2023/06/20,5,Great app. Love the pc experience and this has 0 downsides. Runs great and is super fun. Awesome progression and worth every penny
Keni Watson,2023/11/09,5,i am obsessed with this game no drawbacks in my opinion
Tyquarryious McBarious,2023/10/21,5,best game of all time
ethan makurat,2023/10/18,5,this game is very fun
Vickie Trump,2023/07/15,5,Very fun game. Keeps me entertained for hours.
krn BBQ,2023/11/10,3,won't stop asking for a rating
Amanda Martinez-Prochet,2023/10/22,5,I love this game it's so good
Beexsee123,2023/10/23,5,Are you gonna add adventure mode to mobile?
Alex Martt Burn,2023/10/20,3,"Good game, butcher still stronk af"
Vaughn Joshua Pyne,2023/05/28,5,"Love the game I have lots of hours on the PC version as well. When can we expect this version to be in line with PC? With pruner, streamer character, etc."
caid bleess,2023/05/21,5,Never a huge fan of the movement in mobile games like this but I also own the game on PC and it's very good on that.
Sarah,2023/05/10,5,"Edit* Awesome work from the developers, in less than 48 hours they seems to have fixed and pushed and update for my issue. Definitely going to be spending many hours in this game. Fun game that eats time however latest update seems to have broken controller support."
Natsu Hasegawa (Oppenz),2023/05/05,5,"Have it on my PC that is sadly not potato because it's a high end one. I was sad for a long time since that meant I'm not a true brotato. Not anymore though, because now I can play Brotato on my potato Phone. Thanks, now I can finally create the ultimate brotato on a potato."
Andrew Lee,2023/04/28,3,I've played a lot now. This game is very fun. If you like roguelikes or vslikes this is a very good entry. Cant rate it 5 stars though because of a game breaking bug regarding the butcher boss on higher difficulties.
Duncan Salisbury-Jones,2023/03/31,5,"At first I didn't see the appeal (apart from a weapon wielding potato) but playing on, it's a really fun game. Lots of experimentation with different builds. Glad I bought it."
Mitchell Capraro,2023/04/08,3,"Fantastic game! My only issue is that when I'm using Bluetooth audio, it has a slight delay that really isn't pleasant."
Chris,2023/05/10,5,"This update has corrected the vast majority of the problems with the game. These devs have really put together a great mobile port of Brotato, even if there were some issues along the way. Huge props to Erabit for being good devs."
Jan Reichner Casilio,2023/04/19,4,Its a fun game but whats with the enemy movement speed. I tried playing a full speed build with the pacifist and the explorer but the enemies always accelerate till they just zip around the map.
TJ Deller,2023/03/29,4,It's good but I'm really hopeful for a patch soon to work out some of the bugs. It's not linking to Google play and it's not saving. Reminds me of the android paunch of slay the spire.
Kyle Grindberg,2023/04/01,5,"Edit:Fixed! It's now showing the green checkmark! Great game, but as of right now cloud saves are broken on Android. I'm signed in on my play games app, but there is still a red x for cloud saves."
Sazabi Prime,2023/03/29,4,"Works great on mobile, however its not running the same version as the pc version, certain items are missing and the item stats are different"
Alexander Tsalle,2023/05/09,5,The game is finally fixed and just as fun as it is on PC! Definitely recommend as in my opinion this is one of the best mobile experiences out there. For me this is just such a satisfying game.
Shawna Beauchot,2023/05/13,5,The game is great! In the latest update you fixed the glitch that made it so you could get infinite uniques which was broken (doesn't make me mad) Overall I would give a 10/5 If I could!
paul blaga,2023/05/11,5,"If you play this game with controller, it's the same as pc experience. Onscreen controller is too slow and feels lagging."
Cole McEgg,2023/03/28,5,Pretty dang fun. As expected from my extensive play of the desktop version. Not even a real complaint or a realistic suggestion but I'd love to see community content somehow!
Alpha WOLF,2023/05/06,4,"Great game, lots of characters and weapons.. upgradable weapons! But I'm struggling to even beat difficulty 0! Have played for 3 weeks. Not one win yet."
Nick Sant,2023/05/09,3,"Nice update to improve parity with the steam version, but the update also removed native support for my joypad (gamesir x2 pro). Please add this back in so I don't need to use a remapper app :/"
MrPooBTW,2023/03/28,5,"Ive been waiting for this and my god am i pleased. I would like to see an option to make the HUD a bit bigger, as it is right now its a bit difficult to see my HP because my phone has the camera cut out."
JuanRaul Gonzalez,2023/03/28,5,Great graphics and easy to understand game. One problem is the cloud saving doesn't work.
Peter B,2023/05/14,2,It's just too unforgiving. You either get lucky with upgrades or you die instantly unexpectedly at higher waves.
Francisco Barragan,2023/04/03,4,This would be 5 stars if it had a save/continue game function. Huge shame to lose a run if you have to stop playing midway.
Just Adream,2023/05/13,5,"awesome game, wish more games were one time pay with full features. Games with dlcs really ruin the fun. Especially games with $100 dollar buying options.. yuck disgusting game developers. Props to you and incredible gameüôåüèΩ"
